## Usage

The Prework study guide can be used to learn the basics fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. The study guide is formatted with bullet point notes, that will only be helpful to you if you have gone through the prework. Personally, for me, it is written similarly to a law outline where certain words will help me remember more complex items that I have written in my full notes.
